## Description

This project was created in the mindset of Moods. How certain things
 can affect the outcome, or help while in the current state. We 
 created a website to cater towards the persons mood when accessing the site.
 By clicking on their current state, a random play list or 
 movie trailer will appear. Studies have shown that music and movies play a big 
 role in the brain activity affecting the feelings one is having. We hope that
 one can find a good musical vibe, or a great movie flick, to embrace their
 current mood.
