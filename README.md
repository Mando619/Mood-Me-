## Mood-Me


## Description

This project was created in the mindset of Moods. How certain things
 can effect the outcome, or help while in the current state. We 
 created a website to cater towards the persons certain mood. 
 By clicking on their current state, a random play list or 
 movie trailer will appear. Studies have shown that music and movies play a big 
 roll in the brain activity effecting the feelings one is having. We hope that
 can embrace a good musical vibe, or a great movie flick to 
 help, embrace the mood.
